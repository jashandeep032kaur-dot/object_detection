This repository implements a state-of-the-art Object Detection pipeline built on top of Hugging Face Transformers and the MMU (Multi-Modal Understanding) framework.
The project provides an end-to-end solution for detecting and classifying objects in images using modern transformer-based architectures. It’s designed for flexibility, scalability, and easy integration into other machine learning workflows.

🚀 Features

✅ Pretrained object detection models from Hugging Face Hub (e.g., DETR, DINO, OWLv2, or custom MMU models).

✅ Fine-tuning support for your own datasets (COCO-style or custom).

✅ Built-in data preprocessing and augmentation pipelines.

✅ Easy inference and visualization for detection results.

✅ Modular structure for integrating into other vision or multi-modal tasks.
